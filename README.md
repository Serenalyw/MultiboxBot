## General Infos

A bot for multiboxing on WoW with up to 25 accounts using DLL injection, hooking and sockets.

**WARNING: This project is still in development, I am planing on improving the interface a lot and adding options for the user in order to set up the perfect team !!**

In order to use it you need to compile the C++ code then paste **"Loader.dll"** and **"Bootstrap.exe"** into the **"test/src"** folder then execute **"start.bat"** and finally you have to add the WoW folder with the interface *(there is a button in the option tab)*.
